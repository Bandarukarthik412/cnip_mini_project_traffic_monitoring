CNIP Project – Network Traffic Monitoring System
1. Project Overview
The Network Traffic Monitoring System is a Computer Networks and Internet Protocols (CNIP) project developed using Python. It monitors network traffic and displays information about packets transmitted across a network.

2. Objectives
To monitor network traffic in real time.
To capture and display network packet information.
To identify source and destination IP addresses.
To identify packet protocols such as TCP and UDP.
To understand how data packets travel through a network.
3. Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Scapy (if used in the project)
Interface: Command-Line Interface (CLI) and/or Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Platform: Windows
Version Control: Git and GitHub
4. Features
Real-time network packet monitoring.
Displays source and destination IP addresses.
Identifies network protocols.
Shows packet counts and traffic information.
Provides a graphical dashboard if included in the project.

6. Requirements
Python installed on the system.
Required Python libraries installed.
Network connection.
Administrator privileges may be required for packet capture on Windows.
7. How to Run the Project
Download or clone this repository.
Open Command Prompt in the project folder.
Install the required libraries according to the project code.
Run the monitoring program:
python monitor.py
If the project includes a separate dashboard, run it using the appropriate command, for example:
python dashboard.py
Run the dashboard command only if the file is designed to start independently.

8. Expected Output
The system displays network packet information, including:

Packet number
Source IP address
Destination IP address
Protocol type
Example:

NETWORK TRAFFIC MONITOR
Monitoring packets...

Packet: 1 | Source: 192.168.1.10 | Destination: 192.168.1.20 | Protocol: TCP
Packet: 2 | Source: 192.168.1.20 | Destination: 192.168.1.10 | Protocol: UDP
The IP addresses above are illustrative examples.

9. Applications
Learning computer networking concepts.
Understanding TCP/IP communication.
Observing network packet transmission.
Demonstrating basic network monitoring concepts.
10. Limitations
Packet visibility depends on network configuration and capture permissions.
Encrypted network traffic content may not be readable.
The project is intended for educational purposes and is not a complete enterprise-grade network security solution.
